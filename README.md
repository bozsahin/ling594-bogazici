Ling594: Exploring Natural Languages Computatioanally


This is the web page of the course when I teach it.
It is the graduate version of LiNG488; NB. grading materials.


Modeling here refers to exploring models which are consequences of a theory.
This is not a course on large-language models or small language models,
which do not attempt that.
